            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>In my free time I like to learn and study, I like to read good books that are fun, motivating, and entertaining. I study math, physics, biology, and literature, but my favorite subject to read about is religion. I also like to learn new things like technology, gardening, plumbing, construction, and cooking. I like to have the attitude of do it yourself when it is possible, however, life has taught me to be humble and ask for help frequently. I studied architecture and marketing in university, I am proud to currently be a student of Brigham Young University in Idaho, USA. I think that having the attitude of always trying to learn new things is one of my best abilities. I am a teacher at heart, I teach English as a second language, I have experience teaching small children, from kindergarten to adults, teenagers, and all ages in between. I have also taught Algebra, Physics, Biology, Spanish, Science, and Geometry. Communicating my ideas and being a good leader are also some of the best skills that I have. I am a native English and Spanish speaker, I am also an intermediate German speaker, and I plan to study Japanese in the near future. Languages and communication have always been fascinating to me. Did I mention that I am a great public speaker as well? Even though communication is very important, another skill that I hold very dear is being a good listener, I can be empathetic and patient with others, always trying to be nice. I truly believe that if people reflect on all the good they do, they would discover themselves in a beautiful and personal way. I always try to see the good in others, I try to help them be better. I just try to live life to its fullest, I believe in serving others, in being a good friend, I believe the cake is big enough for everyone, I try to go about doing good. </p>
