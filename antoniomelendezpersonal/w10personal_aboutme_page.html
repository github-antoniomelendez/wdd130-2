            <h2>About me!</h2>
            <p>My name is Antonio but my friends call me Tony, I am a family man, I have a wonderful wife and three children; two intelligent boys, Antonio (9), Alessandro (8), and one playful little girl, Sara (3). They are my world! As a family we like to go the beach, study together and visit museums. I am a faithful member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, so values are very important to me, I consider myself a respectful, honest, and responsible person. One of the best life experiences that I have is being a full-time missionary for the Church. I served for two years with wonderful people from around the globe, during my mission, I learned good life habits, I work as a team every day to reach important goals, I learned to be a leader, to communicate effectively with people from many nationalities, and among many other things, I learned to work hard. I have had the good fortune of working with many people from different cultures, different backgrounds, all age groups, many different countries, religions, and nationalities. Learning from all these people has been one of the best experiences in my life, I have worked with people from all the continents of this planet. Their friendship, their struggles, their support and their teachings have made me a wiser and more intelligent person. I am a fun, social and outgoing person, I like to exercise both my mind and my body. I do this by learning and studying every day. I am currently an online student, studying Web Design and Computer Programming at Brigham Young University in Idaho, USA. I also study German and I would like to study Japanese in the near future, I love languages and communicating with people in their native tongue. For fun I love to exercise, play sports, my favorites being football, boxing and basketball, I do not have much time for watching sports today, but I try to keep up. I also like to play videogames to relax, I like to read, paint, draw and solve all kinds of puzzles. I like to spend time with friends and family, play board games and strategy games. I am also fan of good music, movies, tv shows, anime, and much more. I like to memorize texts and exercise my mind with all kinds of difficult challenges. In conclusion you can say that I love knowledge and solving problems. </p>
