      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Antonio but my friends call me Tony, I am a family man, I have a wonderful wife and three children; two intelligent boys, Antonio (9), Alessandro (8), and one playful little girl, Sara (3). They are my world! As a family we like to go the beach, study together and visit museums. 
        I am a faithful member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, so values are very important to me, I consider myself a respectful, honest, and responsible person. One of the best life experiences that I have is being a full-time missionary for the Church. I served for two years with wonderful people from around the globe, during my mission, I learned good life habits, I work as a team every day to reach important goals, I learned to be a leader, to communicate effectively with people from many nationalities, and among many other things, I learned to work hard. 
        I have had the good fortune of working with many people from different cultures, different backgrounds, all age groups, many different countries, religions, and nationalities. Learning from all these people has been one of the best experiences in my life, I have worked with people from all the continents of this planet. Their friendship, their struggles, their support and their teachings have made me a wiser and more intelligent person.
        I am a fun, social and outgoing person, I like to exercise both my mind and my body. I do this by learning and studying every day. I am currently an online student, studying Web Design and Computer Programming at Brigham Young University in Idaho, USA. I also study German and I would like to study Japanese in the near future, I love languages and communicating with people in their native tongue.
        For fun I love to exercise, play sports, my favorites being football, boxing and basketball, I do not have much time for watching sports today, but I try to keep up. I also like to play videogames to relax, I like to read, paint, draw and solve all kinds of puzzles. I like to spend time with friends and family, play board games and strategy games. I am also fan of good music, movies, tv shows, anime, and much more. 
        I like to memorize texts and exercise my mind with all kinds of difficult challenges. In conclusion you can say that I love knowledge and solving problems.

      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>
        In my free time I like to learn and study, I like to read good books that are fun, motivating, and entertaining. I study math, physics, biology, and literature, but my favorite subject to read about is religion. I also like to learn new things like technology, gardening, plumbing, construction, and cooking. I like to have the attitude of do it yourself when it is possible, however, life has taught me to be humble and ask for help frequently.
        I studied architecture and marketing in university, I am proud to currently be a student of Brigham Young University in Idaho, USA. I think that having the attitude of always trying to learn new things is one of my best abilities.
        I am a teacher at heart, I teach English as a second language, I have experience teaching small children, from kindergarten to adults, teenagers, and all ages in between. I have also taught Algebra, Physics, Biology, Spanish, Science, and Geometry. 
        Communicating my ideas and being a good leader are also some of the best skills that I have. I am a native English and Spanish speaker, I am also an intermediate German speaker, and I plan to study Japanese in the near future. Languages and communication have always been fascinating to me. Did I mention that I am a great public speaker as well?
        Even though communication is very important, another skill that I hold very dear is being a good listener, I can be empathetic and patient with others, always trying to be nice.
        I truly believe that if people reflect on all the good they do, they would discover themselves in a beautiful and personal way. I always try to see the good in others, I try to help them be better. I just try to live life to its fullest, I believe in serving others, in being a good friend, I believe the cake is big enough for everyone, I try to go about doing good.
